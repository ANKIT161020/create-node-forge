üåê public/ - Static Assets
This directory is used to serve static files directly to clients. These are files that don't require any server-side processing and can be accessed directly via their URL.

Purpose: To provide a location for static assets like favicons, images, CSS files, or client-side JavaScript that are served directly by the Express express.static middleware.

What you'll find here:

favicon.ico: Your website's icon, displayed in browser tabs.

Any other static files you might want to serve directly (e.g., robots.txt, sitemap.xml, static HTML files if this were a full-stack app).

Key Rules & Best Practices for public/:

Static Content Only: Only place files here that are meant to be served as-is to the client. No server-side logic should be present.

No Sensitive Data: Never store sensitive information (like API keys, private data) in this folder, as its contents are publicly accessible.

Caching: Browsers will often cache these static assets. Ensure proper caching headers are set (Express's express.static handles this by default).
