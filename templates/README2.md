🚀 Node.js Monolithic Backend Template 🚀
Welcome to your production-ready Node.js backend template! This project is designed to give you a strong, clean, and well-structured starting point for building scalable and maintainable monolithic APIs. It comes packed with modern best practices and essential tools, so you can focus on writing your unique application logic.

✨ Key Features at a Glance
TypeScript: Write safer, more robust code with static typing.

Layered Architecture: Clear separation of concerns (Controllers, Services, Repositories, Models) for better organization.

Authentication: Secure JWT-based user authentication with password hashing.

Input Validation: Robust data validation using Joi to protect your API.

Centralized Error Handling: Consistent and predictable error responses.

Structured Logging: Powerful logging with Winston for better debugging and monitoring.

Comprehensive Testing: Unit and integration tests with Jest to ensure code quality.

Code Quality & Style: Enforced with ESLint (Airbnb config) and Prettier for consistent, readable code.

Deployment Ready: Includes Docker setup for easy containerization.

API Documentation: Interactive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation generated directly from your code.

Performance: Built-in response compression for faster data transfer.

Security: Essential security middlewares like Helmet, CORS, and Rate Limiting.

🚀 Getting Started (Quick Setup)
Follow these simple steps to get your development environment up and running in minutes.

Prerequisites:

Node.js: Latest LTS version recommended.

npm or Yarn: For package management.

MongoDB: A running MongoDB instance (local or remote).

Docker: (Optional) If you prefer containerized development.

1. Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/nodejs-monolith-template.git](https://github.com/your-username/nodejs-monolith-template.git)
cd nodejs-monolith-template

2. Install project dependencies:

npm install

# or yarn install

3. Set up your environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root of your project by copying the example:

cp .env.example .env

Now, open the newly created .env file and fill in the values. These are crucial for your application to run.

Example .env content:

# --- Application Environment ---

NODE_ENV=development # Set to 'production' for production deployments
PORT=5000 # The port your server will listen on

# --- MongoDB Database Configuration ---

# Replace with your actual MongoDB connection string

MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/your_app_dev
MONGODB_URI_TEST=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/your_app_test

# --- JSON Web Token (JWT) Configuration ---

# IMPORTANT: Use a very long, random, and secret string for production!

JWT_SECRET=a_very_long_and_random_secret_key_for_jwt_development_only_change_me_in_prod
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRATION_MINUTES=30 # How long access tokens are valid (in minutes)
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION_DAYS=7 # How long refresh tokens are valid (in days)

4. Start the development server:

npm run dev

You should see messages indicating that your server is running, typically at http://localhost:5000.

Check the API Documentation:

Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:5000/api-docs
Here you will find interactive documentation for all your API endpoints.

📂 Project Structure Explained
This template follows a highly organized, layered architecture. To help you navigate and contribute effectively, each major directory contains its own README.md file. These READMEs provide specific details about:

The folder's purpose.

🛠️ Available Scripts (npm commands)
These scripts help you develop, test, and maintain your application:

npm run dev: Starts the application in development mode with live reloading (using ts-node-dev).

npm start: Starts the application in production mode (requires a prior npm run build).

npm run build: Compiles your TypeScript code into JavaScript, outputting to the dist/ folder.

npm test: Runs all unit and integration tests.

npm run test:unit: Runs only your unit tests.

npm run test:integration: Runs only your integration tests.

npm run lint: Checks your code for linting errors without fixing.

npm run lint:fix: Checks and automatically fixes most linting errors based on ESLint rules.

npm run format: Formats your code using Prettier.

npm run docker:dev: Builds and runs your application and a MongoDB instance using Docker Compose, ideal for local development.

npm run docker:build: Builds the production-ready Docker image for your application.
